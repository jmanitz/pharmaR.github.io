# The R Consortium

The R Validation Hub is an [R Consortium Working Group](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups).  The R Consortium supports several related working groups.  These working groups have a similar overall objective (to support the use of R within the biopharmaceutical industry) but the working groups are complementary: each has its own distinct deliverables; and many of the R Validation Hub's members are also members of the other working groups.

## Conferences

The R Validation Hub was started by the [PSI AIMS Special Interest Group](https://psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/aims).  However, support for the initiative grew rapidly following the inaugural R/Pharma Conference in Boston.  The [R/Pharma Conference](https://rinpharma.com/) continues to grow in popularity and serves as a breeding ground for new ideas an initiatives relating to R.

The [R/Medicine conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/) is also growing in popularity with a strong participation from R Validation Hub participants.

## Submission Focus

As we stater in our mission statement, *"R Validation Hub is a collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting"*.  The biopharmaceutical regulatory setting is one that (ideally) ends with a submission.  Our aim is provide a framework for using R to ensure that any results generated are accurate, traceable and reproducible.
